### Built-in Functions Library
Fixel is a language that can be used by consumers right out of the box: it comes with an assortment of functions that can be stacked and customized by the user to begin making transformations on their images. Given a basic understanding for image manipulation, the user can begin creating custom filters and if desired, more advanced programs in Fixel. For a deeper explanation of Fixel's built-in functions and their uses, please consult the white paper.
