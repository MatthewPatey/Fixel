## Lessons Learned
ideas (could also be advice)
1. write a sample program on day one when choosing language
2. Take time to make sure everyone is on same page when making big project decisions

### Amrita
Writing Fixel not only gave me insight into the art of crafting a programming language, but also a deeper understanding of our target language, Python, as well. In making design decisions about our own language, I learned a great deal about Python, and how its implementation would inform our own language's structure. Working on a translator gave was a great way to really critically understand the implications of the concepts learned during the semester, such as typing, scope, etc. 

Writing Fixel would certainly not have been as efficient or pleasant as it was if not for our team group dynamic. Early on, we decided on a weekly meeting schedule to best accommodate our team members' varied schedules. This emphasis on weekly meetings really helped maintain productivity levels throughout the semester.

I was both impressed and intimidated when I first heard that Computer Engineering students were required to take a course like Programming Languages and Translators. I was under the impression that developing a computer language required an large team of scientist and engineers. However in just a few months, my team and I created a fantastic language for editing images. Even though this project was very technical, I think the skills I learned regarding team building and organization. Tools like Git, Google Docs, and Jenkins helped facilitate this process.

I would advise future teams to start small with their projects. Every team will make changes as the project progresses and making these changes will be difficult if the project is too complicated. Create a minimal viable language with a small "hello world" type program. From there, add any additional functionality to your language may need.

The idea of building a programming language from the ground up is daunting, but given the right mix of expertises, it can be a pleasant experience. What worked well for us was our shared enthusiasm for the idea of the programâ€”everyone was on board with the goals laid out in our initial meetings, and so we had a pretty comprehensive vision for the language from the beginning. It always helps to have one individual who has a clear vision for how we will implement the language from the technical standpoint. For us, that was Matt, nominally our tester and validator. It was helpful to have him manage the abstract implementation for the parser and lexer, with all of us sharing the work for coding them. Everyone seemed to find their niche fairly quickly, and I think we did a good job of distributing assignments that tapped into our team members' strengths.

One piece of advice I'd give to future teams is to really hammer down the tutorial as early as possible. If there is the possibility for change, that should be discussed from the onset, rather than halfway into the process for building the lexer or parser. It's difficult to understate the importance of the tutorial, as the programs described therein will form the foundation of the compiler.

### Kavita
Creating fixel provided a novel opportunity to view programming in a new light.  While working on this project it became necessary to understand why decisions were made in programming languages and not just memorize the rules.  Here are just some of the many things I learned:

1. Make sure to understand everything along the way.  A small misunderstanding early on can snowball into a much bigger problem later on.

2. Planning and communication are essential.

3. Weekly team meetings provide consistency and an organizational framework.

4. Never underestimate the importance and usefulness of Git.

5. A great team makes all the difference!

### Matt
1. The early the test suite is started the better. Even before we had a working translator to test, thinking about how the translator would be tested helped clarify what needed to be done. Also, having testing working early allowed the whole team to write tests as they work on the translator, which was a lot easier than going back afterwards and trying to figure out how to write tests for a large code base.
2. It was very important to decide on a general work flow as a team. Developing such a complex software project is a challenge in its own right, and adding source control and collaboration to the mix makes it even more complicated. Having the whole team use the same work pattern makes handling merge conflicts and other source control issues manageable.
3. Designing the layout for a project as big as this is not a trivial task. Creating a layout that is intuitive, simple, and works well is quite a challenge. Making the project easy to use and test is also very useful. Being able to easily run the translator on an input and see all the intermediate steps of translation makes debugging a lot easier.

## Advice for Future Teams
Developing your own language is a very rigorous and rewarding endeavour. Here's some advice to help in the process.

1. Start early.

2. Plan ahead.  Stick to your plans.

3. Develop clear milestones to maintain progress.

4. Make sure your goals are practical.  Its better to do it right.

5. Use version control.  Especially in large groups this is paramount.

6. Maintain open communication with TAs and the professor.  Also, referencing examples can help make sure you are on the right track

7. Keep track of decisions made so everyone is on the same page.

8. Make skeleton of your program before delving into more complex functionality.  This will make your job easier later on.

9.  Have weekly scheduled meetings or other times when the team can meet in person.  This really helps with communication.

10. Have fun!

11. plan as a group, work individually or in pairs
