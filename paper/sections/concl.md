Creating fixel provided a novel opportunity to view programming in a new light.  While working on this project it became necessary to understand why decisions were made in programming languages and not just memorize the rules.  Here are just some of the many things I learned:

1. Make sure to understand everything along the way.  A small misunderstanding early on can snowball into a much bigger problem later on.

2. Planning and communication are essential.

3. Weekly team meetings provide consistency and an organizational framework.

4. Never underestimate the importance and usefulness of Git.

5. A great team makes all the difference!

### Matt
I like Vin Diesel!

## Advice for Future Teams
Developing your own language is a very rigorous and rewarding endeavour. Here's some advice to help in the process.

1. Start early.

2. Plan ahead.  Stick to your plans.

3. Develop clear milestones to maintain progress.

4. Make sure your goals are practical.  Its better to do it right.

5. Use version control.  Especially in large groups this is paramount.

6. Maintain open communication with TAs and the professor.  Also, referencing examples can help make sure you are on the right track

7. Keep track of decisions made so everyone is on the same page.

8. Make skeleton of your program before delving into more complex functionality.  This will make your job easier later on.

9.  Have weekly scheduled meetings or other times when the team can meet in person.  This really helps with communication.

10. Have fun!
