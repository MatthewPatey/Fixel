## Lessons Learned
ideas (could also be advice)
1. write a sample program on day one when choosing language
2. Take time to make sure everyone is on same page when making big project decisions

### Amrita
Writing Fixel not only gave me insight into the art of crafting a programming language, but also a depeer understanding of our target language, Python, as well. In making design decisions about our own language, I learned a great deal about Python, and how its implementation would inform our own language's structure. Working on a translator gave was a great way to really critically understand the implications of the concepts learned during the semester, such as typing, scope, etc. 

Writing Fixel would certainly not have been as efficient or pleasant as it was if not for our team group dynamic. Early on, we decided on a weekly meeting schedule to best accommodate our team members' varied schedules. This emphasis on weekly meetings really helped maintain productivity levels throughout the semester.

Creating fixel provided a novel opportunity to view programming in a new light.  While working on this project it became necessary to understand why decisions were made in programming languages and not just memorize the rules.  Here are just some of the many things I learned:

1. Make sure to understand everything along the way.  A small misunderstanding early on can snowball into a much bigger problem later on.

2. Planning and communication are essential.

3. Weekly team meetings provide consistency and an organizational framework.

4. Never underestimate the importance and usefulness of Git.

5. A great team makes all the difference!

1. The early the test suite is started the better. Even before we had a working translator to test, thinking about how the translator would be tested helped clarify what needed to be done. Also, having testing working early allowed the whole team to write tests as they work on the translator, which was a lot easier than going back afterwards and trying to figure out how to write tests for a large code base.
2. It was very important to decide on a general work flow as a team. Developing such a complex software project is a challenge in its own right, and adding source control and collaboration to the mix makes it even more complicated. Having the whole team use the same work pattern makes handling merge conflicts and other source control issues manageable.
3. Designing the layout for a project as big as this is not a trivial task. Creating a layout that is intuitive, simple, and works well is quite a challenge. Making the project easy to use and test is also very useful. Being able to easily run the translator on an input and see all the intermediate steps of translation makes debugging a lot easier.

## Advice for Future Teams
Developing your own language is a very rigorous and rewarding endeavour. Here's some advice to help in the process.

1. Start early.

2. Plan ahead.  Stick to your plans.

3. Develop clear milestones to maintain progress.

4. Make sure your goals are practical.  Its better to do it right.

5. Use version control.  Especially in large groups this is paramount.

6. Maintain open communication with TAs and the professor.  Also, referencing examples can help make sure you are on the right track

7. Keep track of decisions made so everyone is on the same page.

8. Make skeleton of your program before delving into more complex functionality.  This will make your job easier later on.

9.  Have weekly scheduled meetings or other times when the team can meet in person.  This really helps with communication.

10. Have fun!

11. plan as a group, work individually or in pairs
